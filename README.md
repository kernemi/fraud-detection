# Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing
## Project Overview

This project aims to improve fraud detection for e-commerce and bank transactions using machine learning. Accurate detection helps prevent financial losses and protects customers.

## Task 1 Summary

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and fixed data types.

EDA: Explored feature distributions, relationships, and class imbalance.

Geolocation (E-commerce): Mapped IP addresses to countries and analyzed fraud patterns.

Feature Engineering: Added time-based features, transaction frequency, and user behavior metrics.

Data Transformation: Normalized numeric features and encoded categorical features.

Class Imbalance: Applied SMOTE to balance training data.

## Outcome

Prepared clean, feature-rich datasets ready for modeling.
